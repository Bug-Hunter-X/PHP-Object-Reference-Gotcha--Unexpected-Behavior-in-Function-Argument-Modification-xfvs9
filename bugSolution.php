To ensure the original object is correctly modified, you need to ensure that the function actually manipulates the reference provided to it, not accidentally creating a new object. Here's the corrected version:

```php
class MyClass {
    public $value = 0;
}

function modifyObject(MyClass &$obj) {
    $obj->value = 10;
}

$myObject = new MyClass();
modifyObject($myObject);
echo $myObject->value; // Outputs 10
```

The crucial change is adding `&` before `$obj` in the function parameter list. This explicitly declares `$obj` as a reference, ensuring that any modification made inside the function directly affects the original object.  This prevents unexpected behavior and makes the code's intent clearer.
