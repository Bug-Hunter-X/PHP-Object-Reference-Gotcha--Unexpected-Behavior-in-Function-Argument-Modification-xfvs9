In PHP, a common yet often overlooked error stems from improper handling of object references, particularly when dealing with objects passed as arguments to functions.  Consider this example:

```php
class MyClass {
    public $value = 0;
}

function modifyObject(MyClass $obj) {
    $obj->value = 10;
}

$myObject = new MyClass();
modifyObject($myObject);
echo $myObject->value; // Outputs 10
```

This seems straightforward. However, issues arise when objects are modified within a function without fully understanding pass-by-reference semantics. If the function were to instead create a *new* object internally and assign it to the  `$obj` parameter, the original object outside the function would remain untouched.  This subtle behavior can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug issues, especially in complex applications.
